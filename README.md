# OWASP Community Docs

This repo is composed of ready-for-print documents related to community outreach promoting OWASP content.

Technical content in this repository is kind of meta, non-original, as we reference and use content from other sources within OWASP.

It is divided into the following target audiences:

* Builders
* Breakers
* Defenders

### Contribute

Feel free to create using any document format. The only rule we have is to provide an optimized PDF version to this repo so that people could find and print easily.

Currently this repository references Google Docs that are individually created. This might change in the future.

If you want to contribute using any web-based tool, please provide a link to original content in a `.url` file with the following format:
```
[InternetShortcut]
URL=https://link.to.your.source.document
```

If you create a better version of an existing document, please delete the old source and PDF and keep only the newest ones.


### Support Team
