# OWASP Community Docs

Documents related to community outreach promoting OWASP content.

Technical content in this repository is kind of meta, non-original, as we reference and use content from other sources within OWASP.

It will be divided into the following target audience:

* Developpers
* Hackers


### Support Team

This effort is brought to you by the OWASP Foundation Women in AppSec [@OWASPWIA](https://twitter.com/OWASPWIA) and the OWASP Orange County Chapter [@OWASPOC](https://twitter.com/OWASPOC).
